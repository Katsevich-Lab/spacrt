Description: 
    Implements the Saddlepoint Approximation based Conditional Randomization Test (spaCRT) for 
    testing conditional independence between a predictor and a response variable, conditionally
    on a set of covariates. The package also implements two related conditional independence tests, 
    the Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) test (Shah and Peters 2020) and the Distilled 
    Conditional Randomization Test (dCRT; Liu et al 2022). The spaCRT approximates the 
    resampling distribution of the dCRT test statistic using saddlepoint approximation, achieving 
    comparable statistical performance, while substantially reducing computational cost. All 
    three procedures support flexible model-fitting strategies for the conditional distributions.
