\description{
Supported Families and Model-fitting Methods
}
\details{
This page documents the families and fitting methods supported in the \code{X | Z} and
\code{Y | Z} models for functions \code{\link{GCM}}, \code{\link{dCRT}}, and \code{\link{spaCRT}}.

\strong{Supported Families for \code{X | Z}:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"binomial"}: Models binary-valued (0/1) \code{X} using logistic regression
or classification forests, depending on the fitting method specified.
\item \code{"poisson"}: Models count-valued \code{X} under a Poisson distribution,
with the canonical log link. Appropriate for non-negative integer outcomes.
}

Other families may be added in future versions.

\strong{Supported Families for \code{Y | Z}:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"binomial"}: Models binary-valued (0/1) \code{Y} using logistic regression
or classification forests, depending on the fitting method specified.
\item \code{"poisson"}: Models count-valued \code{Y} under a Poisson distribution,
with the canonical log link. Appropriate for non-negative integer outcomes.
\item \code{"negative.binomial"}: Used when \code{Y} exhibits overdispersed
count behavior that cannot be captured by a Poisson model. The dispersion
parameter (theta) is estimated internally using a vendored \verb{C++} implementation
based on code from the \pkg{sceptre} package. The procedure first attempts
maximum likelihood estimation via Newton's method, with a fallback to a
method-of-moments estimator if convergence fails.
}

Other families may be added in future versions.

\strong{Supported Model-fitting Methods:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"glm"}: Fits a generalized linear model using \code{stats::glm()},
with the model family determined by the specified family string
(e.g., \code{"binomial"}, \code{"poisson"}, etc.). An intercept is automatically
included in the model; users should provide \code{Z} without an intercept column.
\item \code{"random_forest"}: Fits a random forest using \code{ranger::ranger()} with
classification or regression mode depending on the family.
}

Other methods may be added in future versions.
